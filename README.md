# lanky
A really "thin" PHP-based language for describing APIs

Check out thoughts.txt for an example of the language

## Current status
Still mostly in by brain

## Todo
  * Solidify the concept
  * Write a parser for the language
    * Static file serving 
    * PHP integration
    * SQL integration
  * Create a demo site
  * Optimize and release
